<!-- **Question 1:**

**Title:** Number Categorization

**Description:** Write a JavaScript program that uses an "if-else ladder" in combination with logical operators to categorize a given number into different ranges and display a corresponding message. Follow these rules:
- If the number is less than 10, console.log("The number is less than 10.").
- If the number is between 10 and 20 (inclusive), console.log("The number is between 10 and 20.").
- If the number is between 20 and 30 (inclusive), console.log("The number is between 20 and 30.").
- If the number is greater than 30, console.log("The number is greater than 30."). -->
